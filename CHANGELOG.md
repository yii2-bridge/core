### Version 0.2.3

- Fixed bug when get *og:image* in `MetaTagsComponent`
- Fixed bug in `MetaTags` when use translation model

### Version 0.2.2

#### Deprecation notice ⚠️
Remove the `imageColumn` attribute from the configuration `MetaTagBehavior`.
When calling `Yii::$app->metaTags->registerModel()`, simply specify as the third parameter the name of the image loading behavior (`BridgeUploadImageBehavior`).<br>
The default name is `imageUpload`.<br>
Example: `Yii::$app->metaTags->registerModel($model, 'metaTag', 'imageUpload')`

### Version 0.2.1

- Fixed clear cache `Setting` and `SettingGroup`
- Fixed create setting translations if they don't exist
- Fixed bug `Invalid path alias: @/Bridge/Core/Controllers` when run command `php yii`

### Version 0.2.0

- The `Settings` value is now multilingual. By default it gets the value for the current language.
If you want to get a value for a specific language, you can simply specify the language code.
For example: `Settings::group('test-group')->get('test-setting')->getTranslation('en-RU')`.
- Caching  `Settings`. By default, settings caching is enabled. If you want to disable caching, add the `'settingsCaching' => false` to the admin module configuration.
Also, you can override the name of the cache key settings in the admin module configuration.
For example: `'settingsCacheKey' => 'my_settings'`
- Web analytics services (`google-analytics-key` and `yandex-metrika-key`) are registered everywhere except the admin area. Earlier they were also registered in the admin panel, which spoiled the statistics.
- Added the "**Clear cache**" button, which clears all caches.
- In `TranslationBehavior`, you can now specify the cache key, which makes it possible to retrieve the translation data from the cache.
Earlier we received data in approximately this way: `$model->translation->title`.
Now, to cache the translation data, it is enough to specify the unique cache key with the second parameter of the `getTranslation()` method: `$model->getTranslation(null, 'post-' . $model->id)->title`. (with the first argument, we set null to get the value for the current language).
- New translations for Russian and Kazakh languages have been added.
- Also fixed minor bugs.
----------------------

# Older versions

### Version 0.9.1

- Fixed admin layout `Settings` usage
- Created `BridgeComponent` that stores app state and settings and accessible by calling `Yii::$app->bridge`. 
Currently allows developer to check if user is in admin panel or not (`Yii::$app->bridge->isAdmin`)
- Fixed #48 — when no translation data is passed in post request behavior was throwing exception.

### Version 0.9.0

#### Deprecation notice ⚠️

Since Bridge v0.9.0 brings Settings group feature it will no longer support
`Settings::getOrCreate('email')` function (as well as `create` and `get` functions). Use `Settings::group('contacts')->getOrCreate('email')` instead.
We do that in order to force developers to make better user interfaces and experience to content moderators.

You can use `Settings::misc()->getOrCreate('settings_i_didn\'t_find_a_place_for')` for
settings that you did not find places for.

Those methods will be deleted in `v1.0.0`. In order to migrate to new syntax you can set
`group_id`.

Thanks.
